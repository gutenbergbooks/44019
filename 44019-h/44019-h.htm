that of Gravity here below: And shews that they

uniformly in Proportion to the Lines B&nbsp;C, D&nbsp;E,

will accordingly raise a double or triple Weight in
the opposite Scale, to the same Height, and no

stand, if the Perpendicular through its Center of
Gravity cut the Base; and that it will fall, if it
cut not the Base: As accordingly we stand when
the Perpendicular through the Center of Gravity of
our Bodies falls within the Base of our Feet; and
we are ready to tumble when it falls without the
same.

<i>Fig.&nbsp;5.</i> This is a Conick Rhombus, or two
right Cones, with a common Base, rowling upwards
to Appearance, or from E towards F and
G: Which Points are set higher by Screws than the
Point E. But so that the Declivity from C towards
A and B is greater than the Aclivity from E towards
F and G. Whence it is plain, that the Axis
and Center of Gravity do really descend all the
Way.

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;6.</i> Is a Balance, in an horizontal Posture,
with weights at Distances from the Center reciprocally
proportional to themselves; and thereby <i>in
Æquilibrio</i>.

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;7. <span class="straight">and</span> 8.</i>
Are two other Balances in an
horizontal Posture, with several Weights on each
Side, so adjusted, that the Sum of the Motion on
one Side, made by multiplying each Weight by its
Velocity, or Distance from the Center, and so added
together, is equal to that on the other: And so
all still <i>in Æquilibrio</i>.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;9.</i> Belongs to the Laws of Motion, in the
Collision of Bodies to be tried with Pendulums, or
otherwise, both as to Elastical Bodies, and to those
which are not Elastical.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;10.</i> Belongs to that Famous and Fundamental
Law of Motion, that if a Body be impell'd
by two distinct Forces in an Proportion, it will in
the same Time move along the Diagonal of that Parallelogram,
whose Sides would have been describ'd
by those distinct Forces; and that accordingly all
Lines, in which Bodies move, be consider'd as
Diagonals of Parallelograms; and so may be resolved
into those two Forces, which would have been
necessary for the distinct Motions along their two
Sides respectively: Which grand Law includes the
Composition and Resolution of all Motions whatsoever,
and is of the greatest Use in Mechanical and
Natural Philosophy.

Is the deceitful Balance; which
yet is <i>in Æquilibrio</i> because the Weights 23
and 24 are reciprocally proportional to their Distances
from the Center of Motion. Now this
Cheat is easily discover'd by changing the Position of
the Weights, and putting each of them into the other
Scale, which will then be very unequal, or
nearly as 11 to 12.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Is that sort of Balance which is called a
Stiliard, and of frequent Use among us. It is only
a Common Balance, with Weights at Distances from
the Center of Motion reciprocally Proportionable to
themselves: Only here the Length of Part of the
Beam is compensated by a large Ball or Weight B,
fixed to the shorter Beam; and one Weight as w
removed along equal Divisions is made use of to
weigh several others, as 6&nbsp;w. <i>&amp;c.</i>
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<a id="fig3"/>
<i>Fig.&nbsp;3</i>. Is design'd to shew how any Force is diminish'd
by its Obliquity; and that a Weight hung
obliquely at 3, 2, 1, in the Circumference of a Circle
or Wheel, is of no more Efficacy, as to the turning
of the Wheel round, than if it were hung <a id="perp"/>perpendicularly
at the corresponding Points 3, 2, 1, in
the Semidiameter of the same Circle.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;4.</i> Is the Demonstration of the former Case,
by shewing that in those Circumstances the Force
P&nbsp;B is resolved into two B&nbsp;F and B&nbsp;G, of which
B&nbsp;F pulls directly from the Center, and is of no
Use to the turning the Wheel round: And so all the
remaining Force is represented by the perpendicular
Force B&nbsp;G, which is wholly spent in turning it
round. So that as B&nbsp;P is to B&nbsp;G, so is the whole
oblique Force, to the real or direct Force: Or so,
in the similar Triangle B&nbsp;E&nbsp;C, is B&nbsp;C the whole oblique
Radius, to C&nbsp;E the Perpendicular: Or so in
the foregoing Figure is O&nbsp;1, O&nbsp;2, O&nbsp;3, the common
Hypotenuse or entire Radius, to O&nbsp;1, O&nbsp;2, O&nbsp;3,
the Bases or shorter Radij, where the String cuts
the entire Radius perpendicularly.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;5.</i> Is the first Sort of Lever, where C the
Prop is between the Resistance to be overcome, or
Weight to be moved 5&nbsp;w, and w&nbsp;1 the Power or
Weight to move the other by: And is so like the
Case of the Balance or Stiliard, that it needs no
particular Explication. A Crow of Iron is of this Sort.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;6.</i> Is the second Sort of Lever, where the
Resistance to be overcome, or Weight to be moved
w&nbsp;3, is between the Prop C and the Point A, to
which by the means of the Pulley P, the Power or
Weight to move the other by, is applied. Bakers
Knives for cutting Bread are commonly of this Sort.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;7.</i> Is the third Sort of Lever, where the
Resistance to be overcome, or Weight to be moved,
w&nbsp;2 is at one End, the Prop at the other, and the
Power or Weight w&nbsp;3 between them. A Ladder
lifted up by the Middle, in order to be rear'd,
where one End is fixed, is of this Sort. Only the
Force being in this Case nearer the Prop than the
Resistance to be overcome, or Weight to be moved,
this Sort of Lever diminishes Force instead of increasing
it, and is therefore of little Use.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;8.</i> Is a common Lever of the first Sort,
with its Prop and equal Divisions, fit to be used as
the Stiliard.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;9.</i> Is a compound Lever of the first Sort,
as long as the single one just above it, where a
Weight at G, by being doubled three several Times,
will raise eight Times its own Weight at A, as well
as the other does it at once. This last is therefore
of the same Force as the former, and no more;
and by being compounded, is less considerable than
the other.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<a id="NB"/>
<i>N. B.</i> Had the Proportion in the Compound Lever,
<i>Fig.&nbsp;9.</i> been otherwise, as suppose the Part B&nbsp;C
on one Side of the Prop B three Times the Length
of A&nbsp;B on the other Side, and the same in the
other two Levers C&nbsp;E and E&nbsp;G; then the Weight
G being but the 27th Part of the Weight at A, will
be in <i>Æquilibrio</i> with it.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;10.</i> Is a bended Lever of the first Sort,
where C the Prop is at an Angle, and the Force is
increas'd with C&nbsp;H, the Distance of the Weight
w&nbsp;1, which by the means of the Pulley P, is applied
to the longer Part of the Lever; <a id="lever"/>and in this Lever,
the Power is to the Resistance reciprocally as
their Distances. An Hammer drawing out a Nail is
such a bended Lever.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;11, 12.</i> Shew that Levers or Balances that
are even when horizontal, may be uneven in other
Positions; that is, too light when the Center of
Gravity of one Weight is fix'd to the Lever or Balance
above, and it is elevated; or below, and depress'd:
Because the Perpendicular cuts the horizontal
Line too near the Center in these Cases.

<p class="topspace noindent">
<span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="dropspan">igure</span> 1.
Is a Sort of Compound Lever of
the second Kind, where the Weight H&nbsp;6 is unequally
born by the Weights F&nbsp;4 and G&nbsp;2, which
are reciprocally proportional to the Distances C&nbsp;B
and C&nbsp;A; and are accordingly <i>in Æquilibrio</i>.
Whence we see how two Men may bear unequal
Parts of the same Weight, in Proportion to their
Nearness thereto.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Is another Engine of the same Nature
with the former; where the Lines D&nbsp;C, A&nbsp;E,
B&nbsp;F, and the Lever A&nbsp;B, are parallel to the Horizon;
but the Lines on which the Weights hang
D&nbsp;w&nbsp;7, E&nbsp;w&nbsp;5, F&nbsp;w&nbsp;2, are perpendicular thereto;
and here a Force or Weight pulling at the Point C
sustains the unequal Weights w&nbsp;5 and w&nbsp;2 <i>in Æquilibrio</i>:
Provided the Distances C&nbsp;B and C&nbsp;A be reciprocally
proportional to those Weights. Whence
we learn, how Horses of unequal Strength may be
duly fitted to preserve equally in their Labour;
<i>viz.</i> by taking care that the Beam by which they
both draw a Weight or Waggon, may be divided
at the Point of Traction as C, in reciprocal Proportion
to such their Strength.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;3.</i> A&nbsp;B is an upper Pulley, of no direct
Advantage, but for Readiness of the Motion, as increasing
not the Power at all; equal Weights being
ever required to raise others.

An Explication of the Fourth <span class="sc g">Plate</span>.
</p>

<p class="topspace noindent">
<span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="dropspan">igure</span> 1.
Is a System of Pulleys connected
together, whereby the Force is increased by
Addition in Proportion to the Number of Cords;
so that one Pound, w&nbsp;1, sustains five Pounds, w&nbsp;5,
as must happen from the Equality of the stretching
of the whole Cord, and the consequent Division of
the whole Weight into five equal Parts, as equally
supported by them all.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Is a System of Pulleys not connected together,
whereby the Force is increas'd, for every
lower Pulley; according to the Numbers, 2, 4, 8,
in a double Proportion; because every lower Pulley
doubles the Force of the former; as is evident at
the first Sight; since the Velocity of Ascent or Descent
of the greater Weight is every Time but half
so great as before.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;3.</i> Is the Axis in Peritrochio; or Wheel,
with its Axel; where any Weight or Force applied
round E&nbsp;F, or C&nbsp;D, or A&nbsp;B, has just so much
greater Power to move the Wheel, or entire Machine
about the Axis, as the Velocity or Distance
from the Geometrical Axis it self is greater. Nor
is there any farther Difficulty in this plain Engine.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;4.</i> This is only a Train of Wheel-work;
which by Composition of Wheels vastly increases
the Force. Thus suppose the Diameter of the Barrel
E&nbsp;F, be ten times the Diameter of the Pinion
G: And the Diameter, or Number of equal Teeth
in G, be one tenth of the Diameter, or Number of
equal Teeth in H&nbsp;I: And the Diameter and Velocity
of the Teeth in H&nbsp;I, be ten times the Diameter
and Velocity of the Pinion K; and the Diameter
or Number of equal Teeth in K, be one tenth of
the Diameter, or Number of equal Teeth in L&nbsp;M;
And that the Barrel N&nbsp;O, be of the same Diameter
with the Wheel L&nbsp;M. Then a Weight on the Barrel
E&nbsp;F will balance a Weight one hundred times as heavy
upon the Barrel N&nbsp;O; which is done by its moving
an hundred Times as swift as the other. For the
Velocity in the first Barrel E&nbsp;F, to that of its Pinion
G, is as ten to one; and that in the Wheel
H&nbsp;I, to that in its Pinion K, is also as ten to one.
While the Velocities at each Wheel, and its corresponding
Pinion in the other Wheel, as well as at
the Wheel L&nbsp;M, and its Barrel N&nbsp;O, are equal.

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;5.</i> Is a compound Engine, to prove that in
a Wedge, as E&nbsp;M&nbsp;G, depress'd by a Weight w, or
by its own Weight, or by a Stroke, the Force is diminished
in Proportion to the Sine of its Aperture,
compar'd with the Line of its Depth: So that when
the former Sine is double or triple, <i>&amp;c.</i> the Force
is diminished one half, or one third, <i>&amp;c.</i> This is
here prov'd by the Wedges separating two Cylinders,
which are drawn together by other Weights, in
the Scales R and S beneath, when its Sides are screw'd
nearer or farther off, to adjust their Distance to
those Weights perpetually.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;6.</i> Is a Wedge by it self, where the Force is
increas'd in the Proportion of the Sines of the Angles
of Aperture, D&nbsp;F and D&nbsp;E, to the Radius D&nbsp;B;
or is resolv'd into two Forces, the one perpendicular,
and the other parallel to the Plain of the Tree
or Timber it is to reeve: And this because the Velocity
downward is ever to the Velocity side-ways
in the Proportion of D&nbsp;B to D&nbsp;F and D&nbsp;E, or
to 2 D&nbsp;F. <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> by the Similitude of Triangles, as A&nbsp;B
or C&nbsp;B to A&nbsp;C.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;7.</i> Is a Paper Wedge, H&nbsp;F&nbsp;G coil'd round
a Cylinder, and so representing a Screw; and shews
that its Force must be increas'd in Proportion to the
Progress along its Cylinder, when it is compar'd
with the Circumferences on the same Cylindrical
Surface, or as H&nbsp;F to H&nbsp;G.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;8.</i> Is a compound Engine to explain and
measure the Power of the Screw: from whence it

Is a Compound Engine in which
all the several Mechanical Powers are combin'd:
as the Wheel and Axle G&nbsp;H: The Balance

Wedge: and the Pulley L&nbsp;M. The entire Force of

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Is a Windmill; whose Force is here represented,
by its raising a Weight on a Barrel. The
Wind is supposed to blow parallel to the Axis, from
E towards D; its several Sails have their Plains
nearly 45 Degrees oblique to the Plain through the
middle of those Sails: Two of them inclining, and
two reclining. By this Means the Wind falling at
about 45 Degrees obliquity on the Plain of each
Sail; the Breadth of each Sail is a Diagonal of a
square, one of whose Sides is parallel to the Direction
of the circular Motion, and has its full
Force; and the other is perpendicular thereto, and
so has no Effect as to that circular Motion at all.
And as much as the Side of a Square is lesser than
the Diagonal, so much of the whole Quantity of the
Wind is lost on every single Sail. But then each
Pair along the same Line, by the different Situation
of those Sails, agreeing in the same Motion, the
whole united Quantity is more than the single Quantity
upon one equal Sail directly expos'd to the
same Wind, as much as two Sides of a Square are
greater than the Diagonal. But this without the
Consideration of the weakning of the Force of the
Wind by the Obliquity of Incidence; which alters
the former Proportion: for this also diminishing
the Force in the same Proportion with the former
Diminution of the Quantity of the Wind, the
whole Diminution will ever be as the Squares of that
Quantity; or as the Squares of the Sines of the
Angles of Incidence: wherefore in this Case of Four
oblique Sails of 45 Degrees will be equivalent to Two
direct ones.

greater as the Spring is weaker, and lesser as the

the Force upon the Pendulum at any Point E, is exactly

it is at rest; as does a Stone let fall from the Top
of the Mast of a Ship under Sail: and that all respective
Motions on the Earth must be the very
same, while it self moves as if it were at rest.

An Explication of the First <span class="sc g">Plate</span>.
</p>

<p class="topspace noindent">
<span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="dropspan">igure</span> 1.
Represents the Foundation of
Vision, and of all Opticks whatsoever, by exhibiting
to the Eye a Specimen how the Rays of
Light do as well originally, as after Reflection or
Refraction, spread themselves in right Lines from
each Point in every visible Object, as P, to each
other Point, as R, R, R, R, R, every way, to be
receiv'd by the Eye in any direct Position whatsoever.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Represents the known Law of Reflection;
that the Angle of Incidence C&nbsp;P&nbsp;D, is equal
to that of Reflection C&nbsp;P&nbsp;E, or that the Angle of
Inclination D&nbsp;P&nbsp;A is equal to the other E&nbsp;P&nbsp;B.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;3.</i> Shews the Reason why a plain <a id="glass"/>Looking-Glass,
as A&nbsp;E&nbsp;F&nbsp;B, exhibits the Object C&nbsp;D by
the Image <i>c&nbsp;d</i>, which is equal to C&nbsp;D, and equidistant
from the Glass A&nbsp;<i>c</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;A&nbsp;C: And in an erect
Posture; all depending only on the Equality of the
Triangles, whose Vertices are C&nbsp;<i>c</i>&nbsp;:&nbsp;D&nbsp;<i>d</i>,
and have their common Bases below E and above F, which
Glass by forming the same Image <i>c&nbsp;d</i>, so to the Eye,
as if the real Object C&nbsp;D was at <i>c&nbsp;d</i>, must needs
shew that Picture in the Place assign'd, without any
Inequality of Distance or Magnitude, or any Inversion.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;4.</i> Shews the Reason why the same or equal
Object, as A&nbsp;B, C&nbsp;D, E&nbsp;F, appears larger when it
is nearer, and smaller when farther off: <i>viz.</i> on account
of the Inequality of the Angles A&nbsp;G&nbsp;B, or
M&nbsp;G&nbsp;N, and C&nbsp;G&nbsp;D, or K&nbsp;G&nbsp;L, and
E&nbsp;G&nbsp;F or H&nbsp;G&nbsp;I,
and the consequent Inequality of the Pictures made
by the Rays at the Bottom of the Eye.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;5.</i> Shews the Reason why a Convex Looking-Glass,
as A&nbsp;E&nbsp;F&nbsp;B, exhibits Object C&nbsp;D by
the Image <i>c&nbsp;d</i>, both nearer to the Glass, and lesser
than it self; but still in an erect Posture. All depending
only on the different Bend of the Circle
between E and its lower Point, between F and its
upper Point; which cannot make the Angles of
Reflection or Inclination equal, as they must needs
be in all such Reflections, without making the Vertices
of the Angles, as <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, nearer the Glass
than C and D: And so the apparent Picture or
Diameter <i>c&nbsp;d</i> lesser than that of the Object C&nbsp;D,
though without any Inversion.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;6.</i> Shews the Reason why a Concave Glass,
as A&nbsp;E&nbsp;F&nbsp;B, exhibits an Object plac'd nearer the
Glass than the Center, as C&nbsp;D by the Image <i>c&nbsp;d</i>,
remoter from the Glass, and larger than it self, <i>viz.</i>
for Reasons just contrary to those under the fifth
Figure foregoing.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;7.</i> Shews the Reason why a Concave Glass,
as C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E&nbsp;F, exhibits an Object, if it be plac'd remoter
than the Center, as A&nbsp;B, inverted, and at different
Distances between the Eye and the Glass; according
to the Length or Shortness of its own Distance,
as B&nbsp;C or A&nbsp;D, <i>viz.</i> Because the Rays from the same
Point still cross one another, as at G and H, before
they fall upon the Eye; and so by forming an inverted
Image make it impossible for the Eye to see
the Object in any other Position than that the Image
has; which Image indeed it self is the only proper
Object of the Eye, in all such Cases whatsoever.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;8.</i> Is a Picture in Confusion; but rectified
by a Convex Cylinder, and thereby brought into
exact Order again.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;9.</i> Represents an Image in a Cylindrical
Concave Surface, when the Eye is in a Plain perpendicular
to its Axis; so that lengthways it is as a
Plain, and breadthways as a Concave <i>Speculum</i>:
Which therefore makes the Picture longer, but not
wider. The contrary will happen in a Convex
<i>Speculum</i>, which will make it shorter but not narrower,
for the like Reason.

An Explication of the Second <span class="sc g">Plate</span>.
</p>

<p class="topspace noindent">
<span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="dropspan">igure</span> 1.
Shews that an Object, as K, seen
through a plain Glass, whose Sides A&nbsp;B, C&nbsp;D,
are parallel, by the Eye at G, appears out of its
true Place; and this so much the more as the Glass
is thicker: While at the same time the two Surfaces
do exactly balance each other's Refraction, and
make the two Rays H&nbsp;K, G&nbsp;F exactly parallel.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Exhibits a plain Method of measuring
the Refraction of Fluids at all Angles, and of proving
thereby that it is always in one fixed Proportion
of the Sines, as the next Figure will explain it.
For if the moveable Rule K&nbsp;C&nbsp;L, with its measuring
Circle A&nbsp;B&nbsp;D&nbsp;E fix'd by the Prop E, to a heavy
Pedestal F&nbsp;G, in a large Glass A&nbsp;H&nbsp;I&nbsp;D, be so far
immers'd in the Fluid, that the Center C may be in
the Surface of the Fluid, and one of its Legs C&nbsp;L
be so far bent from a rectilinear Position, that the
Refraction of the Fluid can just make it appear as
if it were in a strait Line, the Angle B&nbsp;C&nbsp;K, or its
equal M&nbsp;C&nbsp;E, is the Angle of Incidence: And
L&nbsp;C&nbsp;E the Angle of Refraction: And L&nbsp;C&nbsp;M the
Difference, or the refracted Angle.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;3.</i> Is for the Illustration of the former Proposition,
and shews the Sines afore-mentioned; as
A&nbsp;D or G&nbsp;N (for they are suppos'd equal, and the
Line A&nbsp;C&nbsp;N one strait Line,) is the Sine of the
Angle of Incidence, and F&nbsp;E the Sine of the Angle
of Refraction, which Sines do in the same Fluid at
all Angles bear one and the same Proportion to each
other; till at last, if the Refraction be out of a
thick Medium into a thin one, and makes the second
Sine equal to the Radius, that Ray cannot emerge at
all, but will be reflected back by the Surface into
the same Medium whence it came, along the Line C&nbsp;R.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;4.</i> Is a Bason of Water, or other Fluid;
to shew the common Experiment of Refraction;
where a Shilling, or other Object at A, (which is
so plac'd that it cannot be seen by the Eye at O,
the Side of the Bason C interposing) is readily seen
there, as soon as the Water or other Fluid is put in
to the same Bason, and appears to be remov'd to the
Point B.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;5.</i> Is the Alteration of a round white Object
D, as seen through a Triangular Glass Prism A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C,
by the Eye at G, where the double Refraction of
the Glass at E and F makes the Object appear at <i>d</i>;
and that as an oblong colour'd Image; wherein the
upper Part is made by the violet Rays, which are
most refrangible; and the lower by the red Rays,
which are least so; and the intermediate Parts by
those that are refrangible in a mean Degree; after
the Order of the Colours of the Rainbow.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;6.</i> Shews the Nature of a multiplying Glass
A&nbsp;D, and its Plains A&nbsp;B, B&nbsp;C, C&nbsp;D, <i>&amp;c.</i> and the
Reason why the different Refraction of every oblique
Plain, as A&nbsp;B, C&nbsp;D, <i>&amp;c.</i> exhibits the same
Object K as a different Object k, k, <i>&amp;c.</i> according
to the Number of the oblique Plains: While the
direct Plain B&nbsp;C shews it still in its own Place: And
while the Convolution of the Glass on the Axis K&nbsp;L
removes all the oblique Images, but does not remove
the direct one, on Account of the Change of
the Position of those oblique Plains, and of the unchanged
Position of the direct Plain.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;7.</i> Shews the Effect of the Lens, or double
Convex Glass, in gathering parallel Rays, as G&nbsp;L,
H&nbsp;M, A&nbsp;B, I&nbsp;N, K&nbsp;O, <i>&amp;c.</i> towards a Point, as D;
because, as in the Case of the Prism above, the Refraction
<i>to</i> the perpendicular in the Entrance, and
<i>from</i> it in the Exit of those Rays, do still, by the
different Position of that Perpendicular, conspire to
unite the same Rays.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<a id="shews"/>
<i>Fig.&nbsp;8.</i> Shews the contrary Effect of the double
Concave Glass, in scattering the parallel Rays; and
that exactly on the like Account; and so this needs
no new Explication.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;9.</i> Shews the Reason why a Lens, or double
Convex, shews a near Object at Q, as more remote
at <i>q</i>, because it refracts it so that the Rays from
the same Point meet more backward than before:
And why it shews the same Object larger also:
Which must needs be, because every Point in the
Object appearing so much more backward, and yet
in the same apparent Angle, its Length and Breadth
must every where be proportionably enlarg'd.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;10.</i> Shews how such a Lens inverts Objects,
as A, B, <i>b&nbsp;a</i>, which it does on Account of the Intersection
of the Rays from each Point, in or near
the Lens it self: Which necessarily infers such an
Alteration: just as the Images of all Objects are in
the Eye in an inverted Position, <a id="account"/>on the like Account.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;11.</i> Shews how a Lens does so refract the
Rays from every Point of an Object, that is in its
Focus C, and B, and A, that the Rays from each
of those Points do become parallel afterward; and
also how parallel Rays of different Positions are gather'd
in that Focus.
</p>

<p class="topspace">

in this Case the Crystalline Humour is the Lens.

Is a Telescope, with two Convex

the Segments of a small Sphere <i>g&nbsp;h&nbsp;i</i>, and they are
to be so placed that the distinct Base or Image may,
by the Collection of the Rays, be in the common
Focus of both the Glasses <i>f&nbsp;e&nbsp;d</i>. By these two
Glasses the parallel Rays, or those nearly so, as proceeding
from the same Point of the Object A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C,
(which is to be suppos'd considerably remote) are
made to meet in the intermediate Image <i>f&nbsp;e&nbsp;d</i>, at <i>f</i>,
and <i>e</i>, and <i>d</i>; and again at the Bottom of the Eye,
at <i>r</i>, and <i>s</i>, and <i>t</i>; but in an erect Position; and
therefore so as to shew the Object inverted.

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Is a Telescope with four Convex Glasses,
the one towards the Object, and three nearer the
Eye: Whose Images are made in the common Focus
of two Glasses, as before. This is like the former;
but only that two of the Eye Glasses serve
merely to reinvert, or to erect the Image, that so it
may be inverted at the Bottom of the Eye; and
therefore may shew the Object in its true or erect
Position.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;3.</i> Is a Telescope, with a Convex Object
Glass, and a Concave Eye Glass; which last, by
scattering the Rays, as if they came from a nearer
Point, makes the Image inverted in the Bottom of
the Eye, and therefore shews the Object in its true
or erect Position. Only this takes in but a small
Part of an Object, an so is less used than the two
former Telescopes.

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;4.</i> Is a Telescope with a Triangular Prism
D&nbsp;B in its Axis; and that Prism's Gage F&nbsp;G for
the Demonstration of the Refraction out of <i>Vacuum</i>

both by the Means of an Object seen through the

it is exhausted. Where in the first Case the Object
is seen higher, and in the other lower than in its
natural Situation; as the two following Figures demonstrate.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;5.</i> Shews how the Object or Circle which

Degrees; and by consequence the half Angles C&nbsp;D&nbsp;H,
C&nbsp;D&nbsp;G, C&nbsp;H&nbsp;G, are 22°&nbsp;30′, and where all is to be
so contriv'd, that the Rays within the Glass may be
parallel to G&nbsp;H, and perpendicular to C&nbsp;D, and may
fall on each side Plain of the Glass Prism in an Angle
of 22°&nbsp;30′ from their Perpendiculars; that so
the Refractions at the Ingress and Egress may be
equal, and the Computations easy.

full of its Liquor rightly apply'd thereto; and both
Arms of the Index E&nbsp;D, F&nbsp;D, equally elevated
above the horizontal Line A&nbsp;C. This shews the
Proportion of the Sine of the Angle of Incidence
to that of Refraction, in this Incidence of 22°&nbsp;30′;
which Proportion of Sines being the same in all

1. Is one of Sir <i>Isaac Newton</i>'s Experiments,
to shew the different Refrangibility
of the Rays of Light, of the different Colours, Red,
Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.
Where D&nbsp;E is a Parallelogram of Pastboard, having
the one half D&nbsp;G blue, and the other half F&nbsp;E
red; both strongly illuminated by the same Candle:
and having black Silk wrapped several times round
it. M&nbsp;N is a Lens or double Convex Glass interpos'd,
which gathers upon white Paper the blue
Rays sooner at <i>h&nbsp;i</i> than the Red at H&nbsp;I: As appears
by the Distinctness of the Colours and of the
Silk at those and only those Distances. Where also
at somewhat above 12 Feet from the Colours to the
Images, the Distance between <i>h&nbsp;i</i> and H&nbsp;I is no less
than an Inch and half.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Is another of Sir <i>Isaac</i>'s Experiments to
the same Purpose: Where X&nbsp;Y represents the Sun:
E&nbsp;G, a Window, with a small round Hole at F:
within which is a Triangular Glass Prism A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C,
by which the Rays of the Sun are differently refracted
upon a white Wall or Paper M&nbsp;N; and become
an Oblong Image P&nbsp;T; the Violet seen at P as
most refracted; and the Red at T, as least refracted:
And the intermediate Colours seen in intermediate
Places, according to the different Degrees
of their Refraction.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;3.</i> Is another of his Experiments, to shew
that White is a Mixture of all Sorts of colour'd
Rays; where D&nbsp;C is a Hole in the Window, which
admits the Sun's Rays. E&nbsp;F&nbsp;G a Prism, casting its
oblong colour'd Image upon a Lens, or double Convex
Glass; which collects all those Rays into its Focus.
In which Case, the Point of Concourse exhibits
a perfect White Colour; tho' upon their Separation
again, the oblong colour'd Image appears
again, only in an inverted Position: as the crossing
of the Rays in the Focus must of Necessity occasion.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;4.</i> Is the last Experiment improv'd; by
shewing that the White Light made by the Mixture
of all the Colours is but imperfectly so, when any
of the several Colours are intercepted in their Passage
to their Focus, or Place of Mixture.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;5.</i> Is the <i>Experimentum Crucis</i>, or determining
Experiment. Where B&nbsp;F is the Hole that
lets in a large Ray of Light: whose middle Part,
after it has pass'd through the Prism A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C, is let
through a lesser Hole at G, and forms an oblong
colour'd Image at <i>d&nbsp;e</i>: where another small Hole lets
thro' one Colour only; which passing through the
Second Prism <i>a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c</i> it is refracted again, and cast
upon N&nbsp;M. And here it is most remarkable, that
the two Holes and second Prism are kept immoveable;
and so the Rays G&nbsp;<i>g</i> fall upon the second
Prism in the very same Angle, whatever Colour
they are of, and that by the Motion of the first
Prism, all the Colours may successfully pass through
the same Holes. Yet is the Refraction by the second
Prism never then able to produce any Variety of
Colours; but exhibits the Image always of that Colour
alone, which falls upon it before the second
Refraction.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;6.</i> Is a Figure for the Explication of the
several Refractions and Reflections of Light, which
cause the <i>Phænomena</i> of the Rainbow. Thus if the
greatest Crowd of Rays enter in Parallel to B&nbsp;Q
along or near to A&nbsp;N, the round Drop of Water
L&nbsp;B&nbsp;G&nbsp;Q will refract Part of those Rays to F, whence
Part of them will be reflected to G: And going
there out of the Drop, will be thereby refracted to
R, which double Refraction will so separate the several
Colours, and make them go out in Angles so
sensibly different, that as the Eye is placed a little
higher or lower, it will see a different Colour; and
that in Angles as A&nbsp;X&nbsp;R, of about 41 Degrees; and
this is the Case of the primary Rainbow, which appears
in about that Angle from the Axis B&nbsp;Q, or
its Parallel A&nbsp;X. Thus also, if the same Line A&nbsp;N
be now suppos'd to represent another Drop, and
that some of the Rays at G are reflected a second
time, and so pass out at H, and are there refracted
to S; here will be a weaker Impression, but a like
Refraction and Separation of the Colours as before;
and the Eye placed a little higher or lower will also
see different Colours, tho' in a contrary Order to
the former; and that in an Angle, as A&nbsp;Y&nbsp;S, of
about 52 Degrees and a half; which is the Case of
the secondary Rainbow.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;7.</i> Are the two Rainbows themselves, r presented as
they appear in Nature. Where A&nbsp;E&nbsp;B&nbsp;F represents the Air full
of spherical Drops of Rain, in such Parts as the Angles E&nbsp;O&nbsp;P,
F&nbsp;O&nbsp;P are about 41 Degrees from the Axis O&nbsp;P, which Axis is
the Line from the Sun's Center, through the Eye of the Spectator,
to the Center of the Rainbow: And where C&nbsp;G&nbsp;D&nbsp;H represents
the same Air, full of the like Drops, in such Parts
where the Angles G&nbsp;O&nbsp;P, H&nbsp;O&nbsp;P are about 52 Degr.
and a half. Where also the Rays S&nbsp;E, S&nbsp;F, S&nbsp;G, S&nbsp;H,
coming from the Sun's
Center, are represented as parallel, by reason of its vast Distance.
These Rays, when they fall upon the higher Quadrant
of the Drop, as at S&nbsp;E, S&nbsp;F, come to the Eye at O in about
an Angle of 41 Degrees, after two Refractions, and one Reflection;
and so cause the primary Rainbow: the Red is without,
by the least refrangible Rays at F: and the blue within, by the
more refrangible Rays at E. But when they fall upon the
lower Quadrant of the Drop, as at S&nbsp;G, S&nbsp;H, they come to the
same Eye at O, but in an Angle of about 52 Degrees and a
half, after two Refractions, and two Reflections, and so cause
the secondary Rainbow. Which is Blue without, by the more
refrangible Rays at H; and Red within by the least at G.
Where note, that because the Angles F&nbsp;O&nbsp;P, E&nbsp;O&nbsp;P, as well as
those H&nbsp;O&nbsp;P, G&nbsp;O&nbsp;P, are ever the same, the same Colours must
still be circular, or appear in the Surface of a right Cone,
whose Axis is O&nbsp;P, and whose Sides are the Lines turned round
thereon, as O&nbsp;E O&nbsp;F, and O&nbsp;G O&nbsp;H.

Is a Balance, to weigh Water in
its own Element, and in the Air; and to prove
that its Weight is the very same in the former Case
as in the latter. For when the Glass Bottle F is
exhausted of Air, it will indeed require much more
Weight to counterpoise it in the Air, than in the
Water; by Reason of the much greater Weight of
the Water thrust out by it, than of the Air; yet
when upon the Admission of Water within, you
weigh it again in the Air, and then in the Water,
the additional Counterpoise now necessary is the
very same; and shews that the real Weight of the
Water admitted, is the same in both Elements.
This Figure does also shew how Trials may be made
to shew the respective Weight of those Bodies in
Fluids that sink in them.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Is an inverted Syphon, to shew why
Fluids ever press according to perpendicular Altitude,
and not according to Quantity of Matter: As
the small Quantity of Water in the smaller Tube is
a Balance for the great Quantity in the greater, and
stands upon the same Level C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E&nbsp;G; because in all
possible Motions and Vibrations of the Fluid, the
Velocity in the smaller must, by the Make of the
Syphon, compensate the Quantity in the larger;
the one ascending or descending as far as B&nbsp;D, while
the other ascends only as far as E&nbsp;H, and so the
Force is equal on both Sides, as is the known Case
in the Stiliard also.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;3.</i> Is to shew the same equal perpendicular
Height or Level in a common Syphon inverted.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;4.</i> Is a Number of hollow Tubes, of all
Shapes and Directions, to shew that if their lower
Orifices be put under tinged Water, and Oil be
poured on the Surface of that Water, from G&nbsp;H to
E&nbsp;F, the tinged Water will equally be pressed upwards
through all the Tubes, according to all Directions;
and will stand upon a common Level; tho'
somewhat under the Surface of the Oil, because
Oil is lighter than Water.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;5.</i> Is for the same Experiment with Water
on the Surface of Quicksilver; into which Quicksilver
a hollow Tube is inserted before the pourings
in of the Water. For the Water will press upon
the Quicksilver, and raise it in the small Tube, till
it bears the same Proportion to the Height of the
Water, that the <a id="specifick"/>Specifick Gravity of Water bears to
that of Quicksilver, or about a fourteenth Part so
high. Which, by the by, is one ready Way also
of finding the Specifick Gravity of Quicksilver to
Water, by measuring their several Altitudes.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;6.</i> Is to shew how Water in a very small
Tube may elevate Quicksilver it self, when it is
thrust more below the Surface of the Water, than
the Difference of their Specifick Gravity requires;
and that it will rise or fall as you thrust it lower, or
raise it higher; and will at last fall out at the Bottom,
if you raise it too high.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;7.</i> Is to shew that Fluids of different Specifick
Gravities, as Water A&nbsp;B, and Oil A&nbsp;C, will
stand at unequal perpendicular Altitudes, in Proportion
to their Quantities, and Difference of Specifick
Gravities.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;8.</i> Is a Part of a Compound Balance, to be
joined to that of <i>Fig.&nbsp;1.</i> for the weighing of Levity,
or of the Power of Ascent in a Body, as F,
lighter than the Fluid wherein it is; and will shew
that that Levity is the Difference of the Weight of
that Body, and of an equal Bulk of the Fluid:
Which is also the respective Gravity of those Bodies
which are heavier than their Fluids, as may be tried
by the same Balance of <i>Fig.&nbsp;1.</i> alone.

<p class="topspace noindent">
<span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="dropspan">igure</span> 1.
Is a large Glass Vessel A&nbsp;D full
of Water as high as E&nbsp;F. Within this is a lesser
Glass Vessel P&nbsp;H, open at both Ends, but somewhat
narrower at the Bottom. Through the middle
of this goes a strong Wire M&nbsp;N, to which is fixed
at the lower End a Plate of Lead G&nbsp;H, with wet
Leather to its upper Surface, to be applied to the
large lower Orifice of the lesser Glass I&nbsp;K, to keep
out the Water from entring into the same any otherwise
than by a slow Insinuation. This is to shew
that a Plate of Lead, or other Metal, may be supported
by Water, and not sink in it, where the
Water is kept from pressing on its upper Surface,
so long as its Depth under the Water is greater than
its Specifick Gravity requires; and that by Consequence
while Water is gradually admitted over it,
it will not sink till the perpendicular Height of the
Column of Air between E&nbsp;F and R&nbsp;S bears no
greater Proportion to the Thickness of the metalline
Plate (with what is annexed to it) than the
Specifick Gravity of the Metal bears to Water.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Is a cylindrical Vial or Glass A&nbsp;D, with
a small Cylinder of Wood below G&nbsp;H fixed to its
Bottom, and made very smooth at Top; and another
like Cylinder of Wood above G&nbsp;H, made equally
smooth on the lower Side, that it may as exactly
as possible fit the other; with a strong Pin I,
fixed in its Axis. Upon these Two, when laid close,
is pour'd Quicksilver, till it covers them both as far
as E&nbsp;F. This is to shew, that there is no such thing
as positive Levity; but that Wood is so far from
rising in Quicksilver of it self, that till a sufficient
Force pulls it up, and permits the Quicksilver to
insinuate between the two Plates, the upper is fastned
to the lower by that Quicksilver: Tho' upon
the first Insinuation of the same it immediately and
violently emerges of it self: As Dr. <i>Moor</i>'s Famous
Trencher did in his Bucket, to his great Surprize;
till he was forc'd to solve it by the Introduction of
his Spirit of Nature.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;3</i>, and <i>4</i>. Are Vessels of equal Altitude, but
unequal Bases, and of the same Quantity of Water;
to shew that Fluids ever press according to their Bases,
if their perpendicular Height be equal; and
according to their perpendicular Height, if their
Bases be equal, whatever Figure they are of.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;5.</i> Is a cubical Vessel full of Water, in order
to compute the entire Quantity of the Pressure
its Sides and Bottom sustain. And that the Bottom
alone sustains the whole Weight of the Water; as
is most evident.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;6.</i> Is to shew that each Side of the same
Vessel sustains a Pressure equal to half the Weight
of the same Water. For since the Pressure at every
point, as L, M, N, C, is equal to the Altitude of the
Water above it, A&nbsp;L, A&nbsp;M, A&nbsp;N, A&nbsp;C, by erecting
equal Perpendiculars L&nbsp;O, M&nbsp;P, N&nbsp;Q, C&nbsp;D, and
so at all the intermediate Points, and summing them
up, we shall have the Triangle A&nbsp;C&nbsp;D as the Sum
of all the Pressures; which being half the Square
A&nbsp;C&nbsp;D&nbsp;B, made by as many Perpendiculars equal
to the longest C&nbsp;D, and bearing the whole Weight
of the Square over it A&nbsp;C&nbsp;D&nbsp;B, shews that the Pressure
on every physical Line, as A&nbsp;C of a triangular
Prism, and so on the whole Side represented by it,
is one half of the whole Water. So that since each
of the four Sides sustain half, and the Bottom the
whole Weight notwithstanding, the entire Pressure
is three times the Weight.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;7.</i> Is a like Method of Computation for an
inclined Plain's Pressure, and how to estimate it;
<i>viz.</i> by the Weight of Water equal to the Prism
represented by the Triangle A&nbsp;R&nbsp;C, where the Lines
L&nbsp;O, M&nbsp;P, N&nbsp;Q, C&nbsp;R, are erected perpendicular to
A&nbsp;C, and equal to L&nbsp;G, M&nbsp;T, N&nbsp;V, C&nbsp;X, respectively.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;8.</i> Is to determine the Center of Pressure
Z against such a Plain; at which if an equal Weight
W directly pulls along Z&nbsp;P over the Pulley P, it
will just balance the Water, and evenly sustain its
Pressure.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;9.</i> Is to shew that this Center of Pressure is
no other than the Center of Percussion or Oscillation
about an Axis, as D. For the Pressures being as
the Perpendiculars E&nbsp;A, F&nbsp;B, G&nbsp;C; and the Percussions,
as D&nbsp;A, D&nbsp;B, D&nbsp;C, the Radij of the Circles
of Motion; and E&nbsp;A being to F&nbsp;B, as D&nbsp;A to D&nbsp;B;
and F&nbsp;B to G&nbsp;C, as D&nbsp;B to D&nbsp;C: The Percussions
are still as the Pressures; and so the Center of Percussion,
the same with the Center of Pressure.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;10.</i> Is for the Computation of the Quantity and Center
of the Pressure on any erect Rectangle under Water; according
to that Rule, that the Depth of any Bodies or Surfaces
Center of Gravity is to be taken for the perpendicular Altitude
of all the Pressures, as a Mean between them.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;11.</i> Is a large Glass Vessel A&nbsp;D, containing Water
near the Bottom; with another smaller Vessel F&nbsp;K with Water
almost to its Top. There is also a Syphon B&nbsp;H&nbsp;K, with an
hollow Stem G&nbsp;H, communicating with both its Legs. To
shew that if you stop the Top of the Stem of the Syphon
while you pour Oil into both Vessels, a considerable Height
above the Bend of the Syphon, and then unstop it, the Oil
will press upon the Water in both Vessels, and force it to ascend
in each Leg; till meeting at the Bend, it run down the
longer Leg, out of the higher Water into the lower. This is
to shew how the Air pressing upon Water may raise it up, and
cause the known Effects of Syphon, Pumps, Syringes, <i>&amp;c.</i>
Which used to be ascribed to Nature's Abhorrence of a <i>Vacuum</i>.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;12.</i> Is a Cube at different Depths of the same Water;
to shew how it must have the same Weight in one Place that
it has in another, because the Water and Cube have ever the
same Proportion of Bulk and Gravity to one another.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;13.</i> Is a Bucket under Water; to shew it can have
there no respective Gravity, or cannot preponderate; tho' it
has ever the same absolute Gravity.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;14.</i> Are a Bubble and Images of the same Nature,
made of Glass, Air, and Water; all so nicely pois'd, that by
the Pressure or Relaxation of the Air included, which is done
at the Bladder A&nbsp;D, the Bubble and Images rise and fall after
a surprizing Manner.

<span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="dropspan">igure</span> 1.
Is a Tube full of Water, with
Two Holes E, F, for the Water to run out at,
the one F four times as much below the Surface of
the Water A&nbsp;B as the other; (the Vessel to be still
kept equally full all along:) to shew that the Velocity
and Quantity of Fluids that run out, are in
only a subduplicate Proportion of the Altitude of
the Fluids, or twice so much in a Fourfold Altitude.
Not can it be otherwise: For twice the Quantity
running out, with twice the Velocity, implies the
Force or Pressure to be Fourfold, as the Fourfold
Altitude requires; and so for ever.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Is a Pump; where G&nbsp;M is a hollow Cylinder,
reaching to the Water below, with a Valve
G, which will be lift up by the ascending Water,
and permit its Entrance into the Body of the Pump;
but will not permit its Return when it is attempting
to descend. D is the Sucker, with its hollow Cylinder,
and a like Valve: which Sucker is pulled
upward or thrust downward by the Handle I&nbsp;L&nbsp;K.
When it is pulled upward, it leaves the Body of the
Pump a Vacuum: whence the Air's Pressure on the
Water's Surface below raises it up into that Space,
and fills it; and when it is thrust down, the Water,
which is stopp'd by the lower Valve from going
back, is forc'd through the Valve in the Sucker D,
into the Cistern above; whence by its own Gravity
it runs out at the Canal A&nbsp;C.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;3.</i> Is a Forcing Pump, in the main made
like the other, only without a Cistern; and the Exit
is out of the Side through a Hole, with a Valve
opening outward, but shutting inward, in which
the Sucker when thrust downwards forces the Water
out sideways with great Violence.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;4.</i> Is <i>Archimedes</i>'s Spiral Pump C&nbsp;D, made
of only a Cylinder, with a hollow Spiral Tube
wreath'd about it; where the Fluid partly descending,
and partly ascending, all the way, makes its
flowing along the more easy, till upon its Arrival at
the Top it runs out at C.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;5.</i> Is the whole Apparatus of the Hydrostatical
Balance. The Glass Bubble G is heavier
than all Fluids but Quicksilver, and is to be put into
all those Fluids: The Bulk of Water in ours is
830 Grains <i>Troy</i>. If when pois'd in Water it sink
more by any Number of Grains, that Number of
Grains substracted from; if less, added to those 830,
do by their Proportion to 830 give the Specifick
Gravity of all such Fluids to Water. I&nbsp;K is the
Glass Bucket, which in Air is in Æquilibrio with
the Scale E: And because when it is let into Water,
it will be no longer an Equipoise to the opposite
Scale, but lighter; the Scale R is to be added to the
Part H, by which the Bucket is suspended, and that
will restore the Æquilibrium in Water. By this
Solids and Quicksilver are weighed first in Air, and
then in Water: The Difference of which Weights
being the Weight of an equal Bulk of Water, by
its Proportion to the first Weight in Air, gives the
Specifick Gravity of the Solid compared with Water:
And if that Difference still divide the Weight
in Air, for all sort of Bodies, we may have a Table
of the Specifick Gravities of the Solids; as by dividing
830 by the Sum or Difference of the other
Fluids, we may have a like Table of the Specifick
Gravity of Fluids, such an one as here presented
the Reader.

Are several Torricellian Tubes or
Barometers of different Shapes, Bores, and
Positions; but where the perpendicular Altitude of
the Quicksilver in the Tubes, above the Level of the
Surface of that in the Bason, is ever the same, or
between 28 and 31 inches high; which is the known
Counterpoise between 32 and 36 Feet of Water;
and to the entire Atmosphere in its several States
and Elevations, where the Bases or the several Tubes
are supposed equal.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Is a Diagonal Barometer, where the Alteration
of the Perpendicular Altitude of 3 Inches,
by the Obliquity of that Part B&nbsp;C of the Tube A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C,
(as a Diagonal is oblique to the Sides of its Parallelogram,)
is increas'd to 20 or 30 Inches Sideways,
for more Nicety of Observation.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;3.</i> Is a Wheel Barometer, where by two
Weights G and H on a Pulley, by which a Hand is
turned, the one of which plays freely in the Air,
and the other rises and falls with the Quicksilver in
the Tube, the Divisions are larger and more obvious
than in the ordinary Barometer: as they are in the
Diagonal one; for the like greater Nicety of Observation.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;4.</i> Is a common Thermometer, to determine
the Quantity of the Heat of the Air, or of any Liquor,
by the Rarefraction of Spirit of Wine contain'd
in the hollow Ball at the Bottom, and its consequent
ascending to the several Divisions on the small Tube.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;5</i>, and <i>12</i>. Are to shew that the Air's Density
is as its Compression, the former upon a greater
Compression, and the latter upon a greater Rarefraction;
and that accordingly, in the first Case, B&nbsp;D
the Standard Altitude, or about 29½ Inches, and
L&nbsp;M the Additional Altitude of Quicksilver pour'd
in higher than the Level H, taken together, is to
B&nbsp;D the Standard Altitude alone, as I&nbsp;G the inverted
Part of the Tube when full of common Air, to
H&nbsp;G the Part full of condens'd Air: And in the Second
Case, B&nbsp;D the Standard Altitude, is to D&nbsp;C the
Depression by the Air, as E&nbsp;C the Part of the Tube
full of the expanded Air, to E&nbsp;F the Part at first
left full of common Air.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;6.</i> Is Monsieur <a id="azout"/><i>Azout</i>'s
noble Experiment, to
determine, that 'tis certainly the Air's Pressure that
raises the Quicksilver in the Barometer. The Instrument
is nothing but a double Barometer communicating
together, by the Means of a small hollow
Pipe in the Middle: Its lower Tube is stopp'd
at the Bottom with a Bladder; and when the entire
Cavities are full of Quicksilver, the Bladder is
prick'd or cut, and the Quicksilver runs out: Hereupon
the upper Barometer's Tube, and Part of its
Bason, becomes empty; while the lower is yet full:
But upon the unscrewing a Screw, and letting Air
in above the upper Bason, that Air presses on the
Quicksilver's Surface, and raises it into its Tube;
while the same Air pressing down the upper Part of
the under Tube, depresses the Quicksilver therein
at the same time.

and both measured by the Degrees of the Bottom
Circle.

<i>Fig.&nbsp;8.</i> Is a Syphon above 29½ Inches high, along
where no Suction nor Art can make the Quicksilver
run, as it uses to do when it is of any less Altitude.

shew that Quicksilver can thereby never be rais'd to

Is the Air-Pump, with its Receiver
and Gage, as ready for Use; <i>a&nbsp;a</i>, <i>a&nbsp;a</i> are
two strong hollow Cylindrical Barrels, in which are
suppos'd to be Suckers, with their Handles <i>c&nbsp;c</i>, <i>c&nbsp;c</i>
notched; into which Notches a Cog-wheel falls,
which Cog-wheel moves upon the Axis <i>f</i>, when
the Engine is put into Motion by the Winch <i>b&nbsp;b</i>.
<i>g&nbsp;g</i>, <i>g&nbsp;g</i> are two Cylinders of Wood, fixed to the
Frame of the Air-Pump, with Screws at the Top,
on which the Nuts <i>e</i>, <i>e&nbsp;e</i> do run, and press down
the upper Piece <i>f&nbsp;f</i> upon the Tops of the Brass
Barrels, to fix them both at Top and Bottom. <i>h&nbsp;h</i>
is a Swan-neck'd, or small bended hollow Brass
Pipe, leading from the Top-Plate <i>i&nbsp;i&nbsp;i&nbsp;i</i>, or rather
from the Brass hollow Piece above <i>n&nbsp;n</i>, which communicates
through that Top-Plate with the Cavity
of the Receiver. This Pipe is screwed to a bottom
Brass Piece, included in the Box <i>d&nbsp;d</i>; which is perforated
not only lengthways, but also upwards, in
three Places: The Middle one for a Communication
with this Swan-neck'd Pipe, and at the two Ends
through small Cylinders; inserted into the two Brass
Barrels <i>a&nbsp;a&nbsp;a&nbsp;a</i>; and <a id="threefold"/>'tis by this
Threefold Communication,
that the Air is pump'd out of the Receiver.
<i>l&nbsp;l&nbsp;l</i> is the Gage; which is no other than a common
Barometer, or Weather-Glass; with its Bason of
Mercury <i>m&nbsp;m</i>, fix'd to the Engine by a particular
Contrivance, and its Index or Boxen Receptacle,
with Inches, and its Cork to support that Index upon
the Surface of the Mercury, and to rise and fall
with it; for the Exactness of measuring the Height
of the Mercury from that Surface. Only this Barometer
is open at the Top, and communicates, as
does the Swan-neck'd Pipe, with the Cavity of the
Receiver. <i>n&nbsp;n</i> is a Stop-cock, that communicates
also with the Cavity of the Receiver, and either excludes
or readmits the Air, as you see convenient.
<i>k</i> is the Bottom of the Receiver, ground true to fit
the Brass Circle below it; to which it is affixed by
the Hand at first, and afterward by the Pressure of
the Air, with wet Leather instead of Cement.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Is a Barometer Tube, open at the Top H,
and included in such a Receiver G&nbsp;B, as gives room
for it to stand upright, and yet permits the Air to
go backward or forward on its Surface, according
as you pump the same out of or readmit the same
into that Receiver. And this is done so, that the
included Air C&nbsp;D, which supports the Mercury, by
pressing on the Surface of that in its Bason E&nbsp;D, is
confin'd within. This small Quantity of Air, on
the Extraction of that in the Receiver, will, by its
Elasticity, raise the Mercury almost as high as the
usual Standard: And thereby shews, that the Spring
of any <a id="common"/>small Part of common Air presses equally
with the whole correspondent Column of the Atmosphere.

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;3.</i> Is a Contrivance to make an Explosion
of Gunpowder in Vacuo: Where H&nbsp;D is a red hot
Iron, standing on its Pedestal E, within a Receiver
G&nbsp;C; and F is a Cock made above like a Dish, to
contain the Gunpowder; which by the pulling up
and thrusting down a strong Wire, with a Hole like
the Eye of a Needle, is in a certain Quantity let
fall every time upon the hot Iron; and on the Explosion
produces Flame, and fictitious Air; but very
little Sound, by reason of the Absence of the
Air that should convey it.

<i>Fig.&nbsp;4.</i> Is a Syringe, which will suck up the
Water in the Glass C&nbsp;D, when it is in the open Air;
but will not do the same under the Exhausted Receiver

<p class="topspace noindent">
<span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="dropspan">igure</span> 1.
Is a large strong Glass Receiver,
or Condenser, Arm'd with Brass Circles at both
Ends, and fit to receive and bear the Pressure of Air
considerably condens'd, when crouded into it by a
Syringe fitted for that Purpose. It has also annexed
to it a Gage C&nbsp;D, to determine the Quantity
of the condens'd Air within. This Gage consists of
a hollow Tube, Hermetically seal'd at D, with another
smaller included, open towards D, and Hermetically
seal'd at the other End. In this smaller Tube is
left a little Quicksilver: This Quicksilver is by the
Air at D in the larger Tube, which communicates
with the condens'd Air in the Receiver it self, and
so is of the same Density with it, crouded inwards
towards C every time of the Admission of new Air;
and by its whole Length from the End near D, compar'd
with its Distance from the End near C, it determines
the Proportion of the Density of the included
Air to that of the common Air. <i>Note</i>, That
the Syringe to be made use of with the Receiver, is
the same with that represented in the next Figure,
as joined to the condensing Engine it self; and acts
by pulling up the Sucker above the Hole H, for the
Admission of a full Cylinder of common Air, and
then crouding it down into the Receiver; at the
Bottom of this Syringe is a Valve, that hinders
what is once crouded in from returning back again,
as is necessary on all such Occasions.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Is the usual Brass Condenser it self, with
a Stop-cock E&nbsp;F near it; to be interposed between
the Syringe and the Receiver upon Occasion. The
Instrument, besides the Frame, is composed of a
Recipient of Brass, made of Two Hemispheres, or
what is equivalent to them, closed together by a
Ring of wet Leather, to keep in the Air; and because
in this Case the dense Air within endeavours
forcibly to disjoin these Hemispheres, they are confin'd
down close by a strong Piece of Iron, and
Screws belonging thereto. The Syringe already describ'd,
is represented as join'd to it after the same
manner that it is when the Air is thereby intruded.
This Brass Recipient will bear Air very much denser
than the foregoing Glass one, tho' it being not
transparent as the other is, cannot be so pleasant,
nor so well shew the Mutations that happen to Animals
or other Bodies in condens'd Air as the former.

B&nbsp;d and B&nbsp;δ, representing their Logarithms, whose
famous Property it is, that one Ordinate as A&nbsp;B, is
to another Ordinate as C&nbsp;D, or <i>c&nbsp;d</i> or K&nbsp;δ, as that
unlimited Space between the Curve and Asymptote
above the one, is to that above the other; and
whence is deduc'd the Proportion of the Air's Rarity
at all Altitudes whatsoever; that at 7 Miles high
it is 4 times as rare; at another 7, or 14 Miles, it is
16 times as rare, and so for ever, in a Geometrical
Proportion of Rarity, compar'd with the Arithmetical
Proportion of its Altitude; tho' all this is here
upon the Hypothesis that the Distances are not so
great, that the real Gravity of the Parts be sensibly
diminished. For in that Case,

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;4.</i> Gives the Scheme, which is made use of
to discover the Air's Rareness, even at such Distances,
as imply a considerable Alteration in that Gravity;
whence it will appear, that the Density of
the Air is diminished in that Case more than 4 times
for every 7 Miles of Altitude.

<p class="topspace noindent">
<span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="dropspan">igure</span> 1.
Is a compound Instrument, to
shew, why in a Storm the Mercury in the Barometer
vibrates so much, by a parallel Case in an
Imitation of such a Storm. A&nbsp;A is a large hollow
Brass Sphere, into which by the means of the Syringe
in <i>Fig.&nbsp;2</i>. Air is crouded till it is 8 or 10 times
as dense as usual. H&nbsp;F and L&nbsp;K are Two Barometers,
with their Basons in the Boxes F&nbsp;F, K&nbsp;K,
which Boxes communicate by a long hollow Tube
I&nbsp;I. E&nbsp;E is a Brass hollow Tube, to convey the
crowded Air near the Surface of one of the Basons of
Quicksilver, which Air passes out of that into a
larger hollow Pipe G&nbsp;G, and so into the open Air.
Upon the turning of the Stopcock C to give vent to
the condensed Air, it rushes with great Force along
the hollow Pipes E&nbsp;E, G&nbsp;G; and as it passes not far
off the Surface of the Bason of Quicksilver F&nbsp;F, it
causes the Mercury in both the Barometers H&nbsp;H, and
L&nbsp;L, to descend and vibrate several Inches, as the
great Storm made Barometers descend and vibrate
in Chambers at a distance from it.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;3.</i> Is a Transferrer; containing one common
hollow Stem I (here represented as screw'd to
a square Piece of Wood, and thereby held upright)
with its Stopcock I, and its Horizontal Hollow G&nbsp;H
with which it communicates. Upon this Horizontal
Piece two more hollow Stems are erected, and
communicate therewith. These also have Stopcocks E
and F, and to these are screw'd Two Brass Plates A&nbsp;B
and C&nbsp;D, on which Two Recipients may be fix'd,
and may communicate with the rest. By this means
the whole Instrument may be apply'd to the Air
Pump, and one or more of its Recipients exhausted;
and afterward any Factitious or Natural Air may be
transferr'd from one Receiver to another, as Occasion
requires: Of which Instrument Mr. <i>Boyle</i> made
great Use in his Second Continuation of Experiments.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;4.</i> Are very small or capillary Glass Tubes,
of different Bores, let down into Tinged Water, in
Vacuo, to shew, that by the Attraction of the Glass
the Water will be elevated, contrary to the ordinary
Law of Hydrostaticks, and that to a considerable
Height; and what is chiefly remarkable, is, that the
Altitude of the Liquid in the Tubes is the same in
Vacuo as in the open Air, and is always in an exact
reciprocal Proportion to the Diameters of their
Bases.
</p>

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;5.</i> Is the noble Improvement of the former
Experiment by Mr. <i>Hauksbee, Sen.</i> upon which
the Learned Mr. <i>Ditton</i> has written a small Treatise.
It is done by two Glass Plains, A&nbsp;C&nbsp;B, A&nbsp;D&nbsp;B,
meeting in an Axis at A&nbsp;B; and being about a
Tenth of an Inch distant at the greatest Aperture
D&nbsp;C. These Plains are Erected in Spirit of Wine,
and are like a Series of Tubes of all different Diameters
less than D&nbsp;C, which must therefore elevate
the Fluid a little at D&nbsp;C, and higher all the way to
B, where the Elevation ought to be Infinite; the
Tops of the elevated Columns will form an Hyperbola,
E&nbsp;F&nbsp;G, with its Two Asymptotes, the Surface
of the Fluid D&nbsp;C&nbsp;B, and the Line B&nbsp;A. <i>Note</i>, That
if the Angle at D&nbsp;C be altered, the Bigness of the
Hyperbola will be alter'd, while its Species remains;
but that if the Angle A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C be alter'd, the Species
of the Hyperbola will be alter'd also, though it will
still be a true Hyperbola, and that if the Glass be
clean, to a surprizing Degree of Exactness.

to prove that the Force of the outward Air,
when the inward is extracted from between them,
is equal to the Weight of a Column of Quicksilver
of about 29 Inches and a half: Of Water of about
34 Feet: And of Air to the Top of the Atmosphere,
all pressing upon the same Base with the largest
Circles of those Hemispheres.

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;2.</i> Is the Syringe, with its Hole; to be
screw'd on to the Top of the Receiver of the next

of the former Experiment; or to shew
that tho' common Air be left in the Hemispheres,
yet if that on their outward Surface be made twice
or thrice as dense, they will still sustain an equal, or
a double Weight respectively, before they are separated.

D&nbsp;B, and that Receiver kept close to its Basis
by a cross Piece and Screws, as in the Condenser
before: Together with a newly contriv'd Stiliard,
to which the upper Hemisphere is hung; with its
fixed Base, and its Gage, to measure the Degrees
of Condensation of the Air, where by the Proportion
of S&nbsp;P to P&nbsp;K, the Weight 50 w. is equivalent
to greater Weights, and shews how many Pounds

If the Diameter be 3 Inches and a half, they

by the condensed Air in the Receiver, will croud
the Air in the small Tube closer in Proportion to its
Density, and so will afford us the Knowledge of the
Quantity thereof.

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;6.</i> Is a like Experiment of the Cohesion of
polished Plates of Brass, or of Marble; when the
Air is excluded by a little Oil, and an exact Application.
This Cohesion may be weighed by the

equal to the same, upon the same Base; provided

<i>Fig.&nbsp;5.</i> T&nbsp;U is a Circular Arch, in an horizontal
Position, when the Threads point towards the
same Center, in the same horizontal Plain.

<p class="topspace">
<i>Fig.&nbsp;6.</i> Is another Sphere, communicating with
the Air, and to be apply'd to the same Wheel in
the Room of D&nbsp;E, where-into is inserted an Axis
with a Circle affixed to it; at the Edges of which
Circle the Threads are placed. These upon the
Friction and Heat of the Glass extend themselves
outward, and point from the Center to the Circumference,
contrary to the former. In both Cases the
Threads, when under the Influence of the Electricity,
will be moved by the Finger, even without
Contact, nay by the Finger and Breath, even
through the Glass it self; so subtle are these <i>Effluvia</i>.
The Light is made when the Air is exhausted, and
diminishes as you readmit it. It spreads and
branches it self inwardly like Lightning, when about
half that Air is readmitted. The Colour of that
Light is always Purple. It spreads at some Distance,
and makes the Edges of a Cravat look a little like
the milky Way, by the great Number of Sparkles
it emits: Which may also be felt by the Flesh, with
a crackling Noise that accompanies them. If you
also sufficiently rub and heat a large Tube of Glass,
either solid or hollow, it becomes strongly Electrical,
even through Glass it self; tho' not so much
<a id="through"/>through Muslin. Other Heat than that by Friction
signifies nothing. It will attract and repel Leaf
Gold, and the like small and light Bodies, after a
strange manner, by turns; when once they have
been fully repell'd they cannot be made to touch
them, till they have been reflected from some other
Body. If they lye between two Pieces of Wood,
laid pretty near, the Electricity fails of its Effect.
With other Circumstances very surprizing and unaccountable.
